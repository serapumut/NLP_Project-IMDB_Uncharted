# NLP_Project-IMDB_Uncharted
In this project, I'm performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) on a dataset of text reviews collected from the IMDb website. These reviews are for the movie "Uncharted", which is based on the popular Uncharted video game series, an action-adventure game. The movie adapts the video game into a film, and the reviews express various opinions on how well the movie reflects the original game and its overall quality.

I'm analyzing this text data using various NLP techniques such as:
Sentiment Analysis: A process to categorize the reviews into positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment or opinion expressed in each review. This helps identify the general mood or tone of the feedback.
Clustering: Grouping similar reviews together based on the content. This helps identify patterns in the reviews, such as which reviews are more critical or more positive.
